New BlazorWebView with WPF
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-3

Tested with Visual Studio 16.10 Preview 1.0 and .Net 6 Preview 3 SDK.
Adding Razor component step is failing.
Error Message: no template could be found with the identity ‘microsoft.aspnetcore.components.razorcomponent’.
I added Razor component manually.
